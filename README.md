Final project for CSCI250

## Deployment reminder

When deploying the static site, ensure that the entire `images/` directory (including `backstage-storyboards.svg`) is uploaded alongside `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` in the hosting root. Broken gallery thumbnails usually mean the assets folder was omitted or placed in a different directory than expected.
